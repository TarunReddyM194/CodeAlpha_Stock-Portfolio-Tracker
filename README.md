# 📊 Stock Portfolio Tracker - CodeAlpha Internship Task 2

Hi, I'm Tarun Reddy M, and this is my second task from the CodeAlpha Python Internship.

In this project, I built a small command-line tool in Python that helps calculate the total value of a stock portfolio. The user enters stock names and quantities, and the program multiplies them with predefined prices to give the total investment. The final summary is saved in both `.txt` and `.csv` formats.

## 🧠 What I Tried to Do
- I created a dictionary with some fixed stock prices
- Took user input for stock name and quantity
- Used a loop to calculate the total investment
- Then saved the results in a `.txt` file and a `.csv` file
